Chainlink Hackathon Entry: https://devpost.com/software/lottery-dao

1. What's LottoDAO?

LottoDAO is a decentralised lottery application based on the Ethereum blockchain and synchronised information from Global major lottery platforms.

2. What's the difference between LottoDAO and other lottery platforms?

LottoDAO uses blockchain and Chainlink, the pivotal data is base on smart contracts, which is safe and won't be interfered by any third party.

3. What's the main advantage of LottoDAO?

With the advantage of utilising blockchain, LottoDAO is bringing off-chain data into on-chain. So you can still play your favourite lottery on-chain. it is more independent, as well as autonomous; also it allows lottery participants to purchase lotto entries in a secure way and makes the lottery transparent, no third-party manipulate and trust

## Inspiration
It was inspired by other lottery game

## What it does
We want to enhance lottery game with off-chain lottery information such as rules. So that people can still play their favourite lottery games on-chain. 

## How I built it
We built it with Solidity to create smart contract. Frontend running vue.js 

## Challenges I ran into
- Using Chainlink to get off-chain data to on-chain
- Using Chainlink to with alarm job and getting VRF random number
- Running single page app with VueJS

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
It's working!!! And It's an on-chain lottery game with off-chain game information but secured by blockchain with transparent and non-changeable. 

## What I learned
Solidity, Chainlink, Vuejs

## What's next for Lottery DAO
get traction and feedback from users. Then we can add support for all global lottery games.
