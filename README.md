# CryptoWood
Chainlink Hackathon Entry: https://devpost.com/software/_____________

1. What's CryptoWood?

CryptoWood is an NFT based streaming service where creators can upload their content and create tokens to access them. Users can buy these token and watch the particular content. The token can later also be sold by the user in the market place.

2. What's the difference between CryptoWood and other streaming services?

The token purchased by the user also has a buy back value depending on the popularity of the content. It is unlike other streaming services where we just pay to watch the content. CryptoWood uses blockchain and Chainlink, the pivotal data is base on smart contracts, which is safe and won't be interfered by any third party. 

3. What's the main advantage of CryptoWood?

With the buy back value of the access token, the user is more likely to watch content here than on any other streaming platform. The token value is dynamic and will depend on the ppularity of the content. Lets say in the rare cases where the show gets very popular and has limited access tokens, the user can even sell the token for more value than he has bought it for. There is also a concept of burning a fixed number of old tokens to generate tokens for new shows.

## Inspiration
It was inspired by the fact that tokens can be used to access content and have dynamic pricing based on the content's popularity.

## What it does
It provides an NFT based streaming service to upload/watch content and a market place for buy and sell of their access tokens.

## How I built it
We built it with Solidity, ChainLink, Heroku and Firebase. Frontend was built with basic HTML, CSS and Javascript. 

## Challenges I ran into
- Using Chainlink to get off-chain data to on-chain
- Creating a market place

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
It's working!!! It is secured by blockchain with transparent and non-changeable code. 

## What I learned
Solidity, Chainlink, Firebase

## What's next for CryptoWood
Get feedback from users to improve.
Add the functionality for the burning of the tokens.
